   <pre> <P>a function is a self-contained block of code or a mathematical expression that performs a specific task. It takes
    one or more input values, called arguments or parameters, and produces an output value based on those inputs.
    Functions are used to organize code into reusable modules, making it easier to manage and maintain.
    In programming, functions are defined with a name, a set of parameters (optional), and a body that contains the
    instructions or statements to be executed when the function is called. Functions can return a value as a result
    of their computation, or they can perform actions without returning a value.</P></pre>
